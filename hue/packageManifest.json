  "releaseNotes": "Fixed a parsing bug in setColor methods that was incorrectly handling values of 0 (zero) in the colormap.  You can now set Pure RED as a color. Added ability to track scenes, and control scene devices as toggle, or triggers.  Can now add a default scene to groups, so that when a group is turned on, the scene will be activated. Added optimistic switch setting to turning on a group when a scene is activated and added informational logging for all actions.  Fixed a bug the causes the Hub device state to flip-flop between on/off states when hub reports off even though it is on."
