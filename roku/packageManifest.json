  "releaseNotes": "Reworked logic for add/remove child key from within Roku TV device to make it behave the same as apps.  This fixes a discovered issue where child keys added to Roku Connect managed Roku TV cannot be deleted, as well as fixes a reported bug that self-managed RokuTV devices would add a child key and the key would be auto deleted immediately."
